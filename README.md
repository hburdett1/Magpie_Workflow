Magpie, an open-source Python and R model configuration workflow developed in Google Colab, to assist with geospatial data preparation and model construction for Raven.

Users can upload their own data or use the workflows data collection section to access open-source data available for North America, such as topographic, land use, soil, and climatic forcing data. The user-uploaded or workflow-acquired data is then formatted and entered into a series of tools, such as BasinMaker, to discretize the basin into subbasins and hydrologic response units and the RavenR software library, to generate the necessary configuration inputs for a Raven model. The Magpie workflow also runs the Raven executable and generates visualizations of the model outputs.

To goal of Magpie is to provide a user-friendly experience with transparent and reproducible scientific outputs. The workflow significantly reduces model configuration time for experienced modellers and allows for open modification and customization, while also providing a welcoming platform for those new to hydrologic modelling.
